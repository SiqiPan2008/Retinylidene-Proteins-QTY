    CHARMM uses a distinct system of units, the AKMA system. I.e.
Angstroms, Kilocalories/Mole, Atomic mass units. All distances are
measured in Angstroms, energies in kcal/mole, mass in atomic mass units,
and charge is in units of electron charge. Using this system, the AMKA
unit of time is 4.888821E-14 seconds (based on the constants tabulated
in Abramowitz and Stegun (1970)), however, for all input and output,
the time is listed in picoseconds (20 AKMA time units is .978 picoseconds).
In some places, the users may specify values in AKMA time units, and
in some places both picosecond and AKMA time are output.

    Angles are given in degrees for the analysis and constraint
sections. In parameter files, the minimum positions of angles are
specified in degrees, but the force constants for angles, dihedrals, and
dihedral constraints are specified in kcal/mole/radian/radian.
