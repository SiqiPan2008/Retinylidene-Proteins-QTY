A structural and functional bioinformatics study of QTY-designed retinylidene proteins ...
(i.e., retinal-binding proteins)


### Pt.1 INTRODUCTION ###

* Families of opsins - vertebrate vs. bacterial
* General features of vertebrate opsin; structure and function
* Activation mechanism of rhodopsin
* Expression, function of each opsin
* General features of bacterial opsin; structure, function, applications

* Why solubilize
* History of solubilizing studies of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin

* Intro to AlphaFold
* Existing QTY studies

* Intro to GROMACS
* Existing rhodopsin bioinformatics studies


### Pt.2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ###

* discuss the QTY code
* describe and explain Table1
* describe and explain Fig1
* describe and explain Fig2
	> I need more discussion here
* describe and explain Fig3
* discuss AlphaFold3 predictions

* describe, explain, discuss MD results (Fig3 and Fig4)
	> I need more discussion here
	
* future scopes and potential applications

* conclusion


### Pt.3 MATERIALS AND METHODS ###
